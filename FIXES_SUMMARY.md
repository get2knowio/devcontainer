# GitHub Actions CI Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing during the Docker-in-Docker feature installation with:
```
OpenSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to packages.microsoft.com:443
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
ERROR: Feature "Docker (Docker-in-Docker)" failed to install!
```

## Root Cause
Network connectivity issues during multi-architecture DevContainer builds, specifically when the Docker-in-Docker feature tries to download packages from Microsoft's package repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. DevContainer Configuration Improvements (`containers/common/devcontainer.json`)
- **Fixed Docker version**: Changed from `"version": "latest"` to `"version": "24.0"` for stability
- **Added Docker Compose**: Added `"dockerDashComposeVersion": "v2"` for better tooling
- **Build arguments**: Added `BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE` for improved caching

### 2. Dockerfile Network Resilience (`containers/common/Dockerfile`)
- **APT configuration**: Added automatic retries (3x) and timeouts (60s) for package downloads
- **Environment variables**: Added `CURL_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` and `CURL_MAX_TIME` for feature installations
- **Package manager optimization**: Enhanced reliability for network operations

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements (`.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml`)
- **Pre-build connectivity test**: Added warm-up step to test Docker and network connectivity
- **Enhanced build settings**: Added `skipContainerUserIdUpdate` and better caching
- **Environment variables**: Added network resilience settings for DevContainer builds:
  - `CURL_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: 60`
  - `CURL_MAX_TIME: 300`
  - `APT_ACQUIRE_RETRIES: 3`
- **Build monitoring**: Added `BUILDKIT_PROGRESS: plain` for better debugging

### 4. New Testing Tools
- **Docker feature test script**: `scripts/test-docker-feature.sh` and wrapper `test-docker-feature`
- **Connectivity testing**: Tests network access to required endpoints
- **Isolated Docker-in-Docker testing**: Validates the feature installation independently

### 5. Documentation Updates (`README.md`)
- **Troubleshooting section**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- **Docker testing documentation**: Documented the new testing tools
- **Configuration explanations**: Explained the network resilience improvements

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced failure rate**: More stable Docker-in-Docker feature installation
2. **Better debugging**: Enhanced logging and pre-flight checks
3. **Faster recovery**: Automatic retries for transient network issues
4. **Local testing**: Ability to reproduce and test Docker feature issues locally

## Testing the Changes

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Local testing**:
   ```bash
   ./test-docker-feature  # Test Docker feature specifically
   ./build common         # Test full build locally
   ```

2. **CI testing**: Push changes and monitor the GitHub Actions workflow

3. **Manual retry**: If networking issues persist, they should be transient and retrying the workflow should succeed

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor CI runs** for improved success rates
2. **Iterate on timeouts** if needed based on CI performance
3. **Consider additional mirrors** for package sources if Microsoft endpoints remain unreliable
