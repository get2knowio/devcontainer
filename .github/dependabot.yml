# Dependabot configuration covering devcontainer features, Docker base image updates,
# and (future) Node/npm dependencies if added.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot

# Multi-ecosystem groups keep related infra updates in a single PR to cut noise.
multi-ecosystem-groups:
  dev-env:
    # Group schedule (applies to combined PR cadence)
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    # Shared commit message prefix for grouped multi-ecosystem updates
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore(dev-env)"
    # Shared limit for combined PRs across grouped ecosystems
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

updates:
  # 1. Dev Containers (devcontainer.json + Dockerfile FROM images + Feature version refs)
  - package-ecosystem: devcontainers
    directory: /containers/default
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    # Attach to multi-ecosystem group so Dockerfile + devcontainer changes land together
    multi-ecosystem-group: dev-env
    # Required when using multi-ecosystem-group: list dependency name patterns to include
    patterns: ["*"]
    labels:
      - dependencies
      - devcontainer

  # 2. Docker (direct FROM image tags inside Dockerfile)
  - package-ecosystem: docker
    directory: /containers/default
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    multi-ecosystem-group: dev-env
    patterns: ["*"]
    labels:
      - dependencies
      - docker

  # 3. GitHub Actions (if/when workflows added) â€“ keep placeholder so team remembers to enable
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: monthly
    # Lower frequency; actions are usually less urgent than security vulns (alerts will still open PRs immediately)
    open-pull-requests-limit: 2
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore(actions)"
    labels:
      - dependencies
      - ci

  # 4. npm (future: if a package.json is added at repo root)
  - package-ecosystem: npm
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    commit-message:
      prefix: "chore(npm)"
      include: scope
    # Group devDependencies separately (when present)
    groups:
      prod-deps:
        dependency-type: production
        patterns: ["*"]
      dev-deps:
        dependency-type: development
        patterns: ["*"]
    labels:
      - dependencies
      - javascript

# Notes:
# - "devcontainers" ecosystem lets Dependabot understand both the devcontainer.json Feature versions
#   and embedded image references (including features specified with versions like ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2).
# - Docker ecosystem separately tracks the base image layers in the Dockerfile.
# - Grouping (multi-ecosystem) reduces parallel PRs: one combined PR for devcontainers + docker updates.
# - When Node or workflows are not present yet, Dependabot will just noop those entries until manifests appear.
# - Adjust intervals (weekly/monthly) based on desired churn; add "day" & "time" for deterministic runs.
